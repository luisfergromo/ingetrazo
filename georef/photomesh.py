"""Photogrammetric mesh — the drone survey itself (Track G, G6).

The other half of the unified flow's first step: ``georef/terrain.py`` drapes a
*global* DEM under the model, this brings in **your own** flight — the textured
mesh WebODM/ODM reconstructs from the drone photos, at survey resolution instead
of 30 m SRTM cells.

Display-only, like terrain and the tile layer: it is **never** part of
``Scene.mesh``. A photogrammetric mesh is reference geometry to trace *over* —
hundreds of thousands of noise-shaped triangles that would drown the topology
engine's weld/heal and are not editable geometry in any useful sense
(invariant #4). Everything here is NumPy arrays ready for one GL upload, not
``Face``/``Edge`` objects.

WHERE ODM PUTS THE COORDINATES (the thing that trips everyone up)
    ``odm_texturing/odm_textured_model_geo.obj`` is *not* raw UTM, despite the
    ``_geo``. ODM subtracts a whole-metre UTM anchor and writes the remainder,
    so the vertices are small numbers (a few hundred metres) around that anchor
    — no float32 precision problem, and no need for the non-georeferenced twin
    (recent ODM versions don't even export one). The anchor lives in

        odm_georeferencing/odm_georeferencing_model_geo.txt
            WGS84 UTM 18S
            717623 8278698

    X and Y are metres east/north of it; **Z is absolute altitude**, straight
    from the reconstruction — the drone's GNSS, so ellipsoidal unless the
    processing used ground control points. So placing the mesh is: shift X/Y by
    where that anchor falls in the scene's local frame, and drop Z by the
    scene's vertical origin (:func:`vertical_origin`).

THE VERTICAL ORIGIN IS RECORDED, NOT DISCARDED
    The scene works in local metres, so ~1750 m of altitude has to come off —
    but the amount is written to ``datum.alt``, so any elevation can be
    reported as a real altitude instead of a number floating above an unknown
    plane. It is derived from the survey and from nothing else: an earlier
    version borrowed it from the global DEM, which mixed two vertical datums
    (the DEM is orthometric, this is ellipsoidal) *and* made the result depend
    on whether tiles had downloaded, so the same model could import twice at
    two different sets of elevations.

Pure geometry + NumPy here; reading the texture images and uploading to GL is
the viewport's business (they are large — a single ODM atlas is routinely
16k–24k pixels square).
