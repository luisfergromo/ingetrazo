# IngeTrazo

*Pronounced **EEN-heh-TRAH-soh** — from Spanish* inge(niería) *"engineering"
+* trazo *"a drawn stroke": the engineer's stroke.*

**A free 3D modeler for architecture, engineering and 3D design — draw as if by hand, built natively for Linux.**

IngeTrazo brings *push/pull* modeling to Linux — where there is
almost no native CAD for civil engineers and architects, and for anyone who
designs in 3D (furniture, objects, scenes, models). It is freeform at the
core (draw anything, like sketching by hand) with an **optional BIM tagging
layer** planned on top: mark geometry as `IfcWall` / `IfcSlab` / `IfcColumn`,
export to IFC, and close the loop **model → tag → quantity takeoff → budget**
with its sister project [IngePresupuestos](https://ingepresupuestos.com).

> *The name is the thesis: **trazar** — to trace, as you would by hand.*

## Status

**Usable — real work gets done in it today.** Draw, extrude, edit, paint,
dimension and annotate; open `.skp` files from 2013 to 2026; tag BIM classes and export IFC quantities; georeference and
import survey data. IngeTrazo is developed by dogfooding on real engineering
projects, backed by ~2,000 automated tests, and its geometry engine refuses
to commit a broken solid (the hermeticity guard) — your quantities stay
honest. It is still a 0.x: the file format and plugin API may evolve between
minor versions, and rough edges exist — please
[report them](https://github.com/ingelibre/ingetrazo/issues).

## Install

Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/ingelibre/ingetrazo/releases/latest):

- **Windows**: the `-setup-` installer (or the portable `.zip`).
- **Linux (x86_64)**: the **Flatpak, from our repository** — this is the one
  that keeps itself current, because `flatpak update` has somewhere to look.
  It lands in your applications menu with `.igz`/`.skp` associated.

```bash
flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists ingetrazo https://ingetrazo.com/ingetrazo.flatpakrepo
flatpak install --user ingetrazo com.ingetrazo.IngeTrazo
flatpak run com.ingetrazo.IngeTrazo
```

  The release also carries a single-file `IngeTrazo.flatpak` you can
  double-click, but a bundle has no update channel — it stays on the version
  you installed. Or take the **AppImage** (make it executable and run it),
  or the **tarball** if your distro lacks FUSE:

```bash
chmod +x IngeTrazo-*-x86_64.AppImage && ./IngeTrazo-*-x86_64.AppImage
# or
tar -xzf IngeTrazo-*-linux-x86_64.tar.gz && IngeTrazo-*/ingetrazo
```

Python, Qt and the pure-Python `.skp` reader travel inside; nothing else to
install. `--check` prints what the install found and exits non-zero if
anything is missing.

- **macOS** (Apple Silicon, M1 and later): download
  `IngeTrazo-<version>-macos-arm64.dmg` from the
  [latest release](https://github.com/ingelibre/ingetrazo/releases/latest),
  open it and drag IngeTrazo to Applications. The app is not signed yet, so
  the first time right-click it ▸ Open. Known gap on macOS: DWG import
  (`dwg2dxf` is Linux-only for now); the native `.skp` reader works
  everywhere. If something fails, please
  [open an issue](https://github.com/ingelibre/ingetrazo/issues) and paste
  anything the Terminal prints.

Something to open right away: [`examples/`](examples/) holds four real
documents from the Yanque plaza project — the fountain, the bench with its
pergola and the solar lamp post with their A3 sheets and PDFs, and the
welcome arch with all its rebar (also attached to every release as
`IngeTrazo-ejemplos.zip`).

## What works today

- **Viewport** — Z-up camera that orbits around the point under the cursor,
  grid, colored axes, perspective ↔ parallel and two-point perspective,
  standard views, zoom-extents, hidden-line removal, real-sun shadows.
- **Walkthrough** — Position Camera, Walk and Look Around at eye height.
- **Drawing tools** — Line, Rectangle, Rotated Rectangle, Circle, Polygon,
  Arc (2-point) and 3-Point Arc, with inferencing, snapping, axis locks and a
  Value Control Box (type exact lengths/coordinates, `200,100` or `200;100`
  for two values), plus Freehand, Pie, 3D Text and images. **Repeat the last
  command** with Shift+R or from the right-click menu.
- **Push/Pull** — robust, watertight extrude / recess / step / through-hole,
  solid-aware, with a **BIM-grade hermeticity guard** (never commits a broken
  solid — the difference that makes the geometry valid for quantity takeoff).
- **Offset** — walls with real thickness from a face outline.
- **Follow Me** and **Fillet** — sweep a profile along a path; round a corner.
- **Move, Scale, Flip** — with snap, inference and exact measured input.
- **Tape Measure & guides** — guide points and lines that every tool snaps
  to, Push/Pull included (stop a face exactly at a guide's height).
- **Eraser, Hide/Unhide, Invert Selection, Intersect Faces.**
- **Solid tools** — Outer Shell, Union, Subtract, Trim, Intersect, Split.
- **Section planes** — live cuts with section fill.
- **Groups & components** — isolate geometry, move / explode / edit as a
  unit, and **copy/paste** with a solid, textured preview under the cursor;
  pasted component copies share their definition. **Paste in Place**
  (Ctrl+Alt+V) drops the copy exactly where it was taken — the way to move
  things into and out of groups without shifting them.
- **Rotate & Protractor** — plane inference with
  axis-coloured disc, 15° tick snapping near it, slope input as rise:run
  (`3:12`), rotate-a-copy (Ctrl), fold-axis by dragging, and angled guide
  lines that feed the snap engine; a click snapped to a point rotates by the
  exact angle to it.
- **Display styles** — Default, Architectural (textures on white), Shaded,
  Hidden line, Monochrome, Wireframe and X-ray; scenes remember their
  style and the sheet composer renders each viewport in any of them.
- **Curved solids** — soft edges: smooth cylinders, curved-surface
  selection, view-dependent profile/silhouette edges.
- **Materials** — solid color per face and **textures**
  (planar projection with real-world tile size), applied with a Paint tool —
  with a **named material registry**: paint keeps identity, edit-and-restamp
  updates every use, Model Info reports quantities per material, and exports
  carry the real names.
- **Dimensions & leader texts** — static annotations with hidden-line
  occlusion and styles; texts select by their glyphs, move with the anchor
  pinned, and edit on double-click. Both come in from `.skp` files.
- **Side tray** — Entity info, Layers, Scenes, Materials (213 RAL colours and
  a textured library at real size), **Components** (scale figures, furniture,
  trees, vehicles, your own face-me PNGs), Dimension style.
- **`.skp` import** — open `.skp` files natively (double-click too), every
  era from classic 2013–2020 to current 2021+, with materials, textures,
  per-side face materials, translucency, layers, scenes, dimensions and
  leader texts. Pure Python and offline — powered by
  [OpenSKP](https://github.com/iamahsanmehmood/openskp) (see
  [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)). There is no `.skp` export: to take
  a model to another program, export COLLADA `.dae`, OBJ or glTF.
- **Files** — native `.igz` save/open (self-contained: textures travel inside
the document), **import STL (with principal-plane or advanced all-surface
  coplanar merging), OBJ
  and COLLADA `.dae`**, **export STL, OBJ,
  COLLADA and glTF/GLB** (glTF with PBR materials and geolocation; STL
  goes to a slicer as is — dedicated 3D-printing tools are planned for the
  future).
- **Layers & Scenes** — visibility/lock tags (plans emerge from one model)
  and saved views (camera + per-layer visibility), both imported from `.skp`.
- **BIM tagging + IFC export** — tag freeform geometry with IFC classes
  (walls, slabs, columns, ...); tagged objects export to `.ifc` with honest
  quantities (areas always; volumes only when the object is watertight) —
  the bridge to [IngePresupuestos](https://ingepresupuestos.com) quantity
  takeoff.
- **Geo-referencing** — UTM datum, web basemap tiles, 3D terrain (DEM),
  traced geo-paths with a live longitudinal profile, survey-point CSV import
  (total station / GPS), and photogrammetric mesh import (WebODM / ODM).
- **Sheet composer** — scaled viewports of the model on paper sheets (each
  in any display style), exact vector hidden-line rendering with three pen
  weights and section poché, numbered view titles, section marks (where
  «Corte A-A» was taken), model-anchored dimensions (chains with a stacked
  total, level marks that read the point's height), detail callouts,
  title block, vector PDF export, DXF with one layer per line class.
- **Extensions** — a plugin system: drop a Python file in the plugins folder
  and its tools appear in the **Extensions** menu. Reference plugins ship
  with the app: **Model Info** (model statistics), a **Python Console**
  (live scripting over the open document, undo-integrated), **Solid
  Inspector**, and two AI plugins — an in-app **AI Assistant** (chat that
  models for you; Groq/Claude/GPT/Gemini/OpenRouter/DeepSeek/local Ollama)
  and an **AI Bridge** (drive the live document from Claude Code/Desktop
  via MCP). Every AI action is one transactional undo step. A broken
  plugin can never prevent IngeTrazo from starting. Plugins are the
  lowest-friction way to contribute — see [docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md).
- **Undo/redo** — every edit is a single atomic step (console scripts
  included).

## Planned

Contour lines from terrain · reference axes, room labels and numbered
legends on sheets · DWG/DXF (with [IngeCAD](https://ingecad.org)) ·
IFC import · extension manager UI · Flathub packaging.

## Why IngeTrazo

There was no good native 3D modeller for the civil engineer who works on
Linux: the usual tools have no Linux build, or are hard to learn. IngeTrazo is
that missing tool: Linux-first, in Spanish, free software, and designed around the real workflow
of *tracing over a georeferenced site and tagging what you draw for takeoff*.

## Stack

Deliberately minimal — heavy dependencies arrive only when a feature needs them.

| Layer | What we use |
|-------|-------------|
| UI | **PySide6 6.11** (Qt 6) — the only runtime dependency |
| 3D rendering | Qt's bundled OpenGL (`QOpenGLShaderProgram` / `QOpenGLBuffer` / VAO), GLSL 3.30 Core |
| 3D math | `QMatrix4x4` / `QVector3D` (QtGui) — **no NumPy** |
| Vertex packing | `array` (Python stdlib) |
| Snapping / inference | custom (`core/snap.py`) |
| Tests | pytest |

## Quick start (developers)

## Acknowledgements

- **[Pedro Caeiro](https://github.com/pacaeiro)** — architectural and
  mechanical draftsman, and IngeTrazo's most persistent outside contributor:
  five merged pull requests and fifteen issues filed from real drafting work.
  He draws with IngeTrazo every day and writes down every gesture that does
  not answer the way a draftsman expects, which is how much of its everyday
  behaviour got polished. See [AUTHORS](AUTHORS).
- **Rafael García Rodríguez** — [Rafael 3D](https://www.youtube.com/@Rafa3D),
  draftsman and reviewer.
  His filmed reviews put the program through a professional's hands and
  drove the sheet composer; his tutorial on drafting standards, with a
  reference plate drawn in AutoCAD, is the specification IngeTrazo's
  dimensions are being built to. A CAD program that does not meet the
  drafting norms is not a technical tool, and that is knowledge we did not
  have.

  Mehmood — the clean-room, pure-Python `.skp` reader that powers
  IngeTrazo's native import.
  IngeTrazo contributes back upstream: material and texture fidelity, per-face
  UV mapping, image entities, style colors, back-side materials, edge display
  flags, and a full reader for the classic pre-2021 MFC container format. If
  you need to read `.skp` files from Python, use OpenSKP — and give it a star.

## En español

**IngeTrazo** (se lee *in-je-TRA-so*: *inge*niería + *trazo*) es un
modelador 3D libre para arquitectura,
ingeniería y diseño 3D, **hecho nativo para Linux** — donde casi no
hay CAD para nuestra carrera ni para quien diseña en 3D. Es freeform en el núcleo (trazás lo que quieras,
como dibujando a mano) con una capa **BIM opcional** planeada encima: taggeás la
geometría como `IfcWall` / `IfcSlab` / `IfcColumn`, exportás a IFC y cerrás el
loop **modelar → taggear → metrar → presupuestar** junto a
[IngePresupuestos](https://ingepresupuestos.com).

**Ya funciona de punta a punta:** dibujás (línea, rectángulo, círculo, arco,
polígono), extruís con push/pull hermético grado-BIM, hacés muros con espesor
(offset), movés, agrupás, pintás con colores y texturas, acotás, y exportás a
STL/OBJ. **Abre archivos `.skp` de forma nativa** (con doble clic),
de cualquier época (clásico 2013–2020 y actual 2021+), gracias a
[OpenSKP](https://github.com/iamahsanmehmood/openskp). En
desarrollo temprano, respaldado por ~870 tests. Software libre GPL-3.0, hecho
en Perú. Más en [docs/](docs/).
