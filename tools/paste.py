"""Paste tool: drop a copied set of geometry, placing it with the cursor.

After Copy/Cut fills ``viewport.clipboard``, Paste activates this tool: the copied
faces, edges and groups follow the cursor as a live preview (snapping like any
draw), and a click stamps them into the scene ONCE and returns to Select.
