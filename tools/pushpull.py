"""Push/Pull tool: extrude a face along its normal.

UX (the usual push/pull convention):
- Hover a face; the cursor picks the front-most face under it.
- First click: lock onto that face and start a drag along its normal.
- Subsequent mouse motion slides the extrusion preview (wireframe of
  the future box) along the normal axis. Length is shown near the
  midpoint, same overlay as the line tool.
- Second click commits at the current distance.
- Typing a number + Enter (VCB) commits at exactly that distance,
  preserving the current direction's sign; a negative value ("-2")
  reverses it, and unit suffixes ("30cm", "1500mm") are understood.
- **Ctrl** = push/pull a copy: the start face stays in place (a slab
  division) and the extrusion stacks as a new segment — how floors are
  stacked.
- **Double-click** repeats the last committed distance on the face under
  the cursor (with Ctrl, as a copy).
- Esc cancels without committing.

Commit pipeline (the deterministic root-fix, no case tree):
1. Orient the mesh outward (entry invariant; no-op on open sheets).
2. Build the *naive* extrusion: consumed/kept base, moved cap (with holes),
   one wall quad per boundary/hole edge — even where a quad lands on an
   existing face's plane.
3. Stitch connectivity (T-junctions, collinear vertices).
4. On a solid: deterministically rebuild every touched plane (seams, overlaps,
   cracks) from its edges via ``core.cap_rebuild``; on a flat sheet, fall back
   to the seeded coplanar merge (no outward side exists there).
5. Orient outward again — every committed solid upholds the invariant.

A bordered (embedded) base face is consumed either direction — pushing in
carves a recess / step / through-hole (the far face is punched when the push
reaches it); pushing out grows the solid. A free-standing face keeps its base
as the cap of the new box.

        The overlay draws its faces FILLED and nothing else, so without this
        the forming solid slid under the cursor as a flat silhouette with no
        edges, and only snapped into a real box once the drag ended (Marco,
        2026-08-27). The mesh-mutating preview it replaced got its edges for
        free, from the mesh; the overlay has to say them out loud.

        A riser that the commit is going to SOFTEN is left out: pushing a
        circle drew every facet seam of the cylinder's side, so the shape
        arrived streaked with lines and only cleaned up on release (Marco,
        2026-08-27). The same dihedral rule ``_soften_curve_facets`` applies
        afterwards decides it here — read off the sweep's own wall normals,
        no mesh needed — so a circle previews as a smooth cylinder while a
        hexagon keeps the edges it will really have. A circle's own segments
        stay visible either way: the Circle tool does not soften them, only
        the sweep's verticals are.

        The BASE ring is not drawn at all. Those edges belong to the base
        face and are already in the mesh, so the model draws them itself —
        saying them again put a seam across the block the drag was forming,
        because the preview's polygon offset let the repeat win the depth
        test against its own faces (Marco, 2026-08-27).

        They cost a handful of points: the rings are the base face's own
        loops, already built for the sweep. Drawn in ``wireframe_color`` and
        depth-tested (class attributes above), so the box hides its own back

        and the prism-translate path (whose flush landings need the same
        volumetric resolution).

        Rebuilt to a **fixpoint**: a plane's classification reads the current
        mesh, so a plane rebuilt while a neighbour still carries its dirty
        phantom can come out wrong — which made the result depend on iteration
        order (set order = the Python hash seed). Treating the faces a rebuild
        adds as fresh re-flags the affected planes next round, and
        ``apply_rebuild`` returning False on a stable plane makes the loop
        terminate. Plane keys are sorted, so the whole pass is
        order-deterministic. No case tree."""
