"""Move tool: drag geometry (and everything connected to it) to a new spot.

UX (the classic push/pull modeller behaviour):
- If there's a selection, Move acts on it; otherwise the first click grabs the
  edge / face under the cursor.
- First click sets the grab point (a snapped handle). Move the mouse — snap,
  axis lock (arrow keys) and the VCB all work, same as drawing — and the real
  geometry deforms live as you drag (faces tilt, walls stretch).
- Second click drops at the current offset. Typing a length + Enter moves
  exactly that far along the current direction; ``X;Y;Z`` + Enter is a 3D delta.
- Tapping Ctrl toggles COPY mode (issue #20): the original stays
  put and a translated copy is created (a component instance copies as a
  sibling instance); the copy's wireframe previews at the cursor. Right after
  a copy, typing ``3x`` (or ``3*``, ``*3``) makes an external array — three
  copies at multiples of the distance — and ``/3`` (or ``3/``) an internal
  one — three copies dividing the distance. Retyping re-lays the array.
- Esc (or switching tools) cancels and snaps the geometry back.

Move shifts *positions*: every point coincident with a grabbed vertex moves with
it, so connected faces deform instead of tearing — that's what lets you raise a
ridge edge into a gable roof.

The live preview mutates the scene directly (no history entry); the move only
lands on the undo stack on commit, and is reverted on cancel — so the undo
history stays clean while you still see the deformation as it happens.
