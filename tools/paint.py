"""Paint (bucket) tool: assign a material colour to a face.

Behavior (the classic Paint Bucket, ``B``):
- Left click on a face: paint it with the tool's current colour. The colour
  lives in the face's ``attrs["color"]`` (the generic per-region attrs from
  A.3), so it survives push/pull and the plane rebuild.
- If the clicked face is part of the current face selection, the whole
  selection is painted in one undoable step (paint many at once).
- **Alt** switches to the eyedropper, the usual modern way: a tap
  TOGGLES it and it stays until one face is sampled (then back to the
  bucket) or Alt is tapped again; holding Alt and clicking samples too. The
  sample takes the face's material into the current one: image, applied size, rotation, translucency and the material
  identity all travel, so the next click reproduces that material on another
  face. A face carrying an explicit world→UV map (an imported texture, or one
  positioned by hand) hands that map on only to faces on the SAME plane, where
  it keeps the pattern lined up; a face on another plane gets the material with
  its OWN planar projection at the same applied size. Copying the map across
  planes is what is usually called a *projected* texture, and doing it by default
  degenerates: on a wall perpendicular to the sampled floor the ``v`` axis
  lands along the wall's normal and the image smears into stripes.
- Works on loose geometry and group faces alike (``pick_face_any``).
- **Paints the side you click.** A face has a front and a back, and
  the classic behaviour paints exactly the side under the cursor: the front of a wall
  takes the brick, its back keeps the style's default blue-grey. IngeTrazo
  used to show every paint on both sides («si a una cara le aplico un
  color o textura también se aplica a su revés, lo cual no debería» —
  Marco, 2026-09-11). The back's own material lives in ``attrs["back"]``
  (``SetFaceBackCommand``); a translucent front — glass, water, a raschel
  mesh, a leaf cutout — reads on both sides anyway, and
  that rule lives in ``core.materials.back_is_default``.

The current colour is class-level (shared across activations) and is set from
the toolbar swatch (a ``QColorDialog``); the tool only applies it.
