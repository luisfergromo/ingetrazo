"""Follow Me tool: sweep a profile face along a path (W) — the three
classic ways:

1. **Drag along the path.** Click the profile face, then move along the
   path touching its edges: the path highlights in RED and the extrusion
   previews live, mitred corners included. Click (or release a real drag)
   when you reach the end; Esc starts over. Skipping segments of an arc is
   fine — the connected edges in between are followed; moving back along
   the path shrinks it. Hold **Alt** over a face to use its perimeter as
   the path.
2. **Preselect the path**: a chain of edges (one click on a circle
   segment selects the whole contour) — then activate Follow Me and click
   the profile: it sweeps at once.
3. **Preselect a face**: its outer boundary is the (closed) path — a
   moulding around a slab, a lathe around a circle.

The heavy lifting lives headless in :mod:`core.sweep` (the action layer);
this tool is the click shell.
