"""An OBJ written as parts imports as parts, and Explode sets them free.

A furniture OBJ names its pieces with ``g``/``o`` statements — a Sweet Home
3D bar stool is 43 of them. They used to be read past and the whole model
fused into one mesh, so the parts a user wanted to select, list or pull apart
were gone the moment the file was opened."""
