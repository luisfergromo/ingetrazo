"""Pulling a face up against a wall (issue #94, @xyont: «cannot pull up
meet outer face… push down working properly»).

A square drawn on a step's lower tread, touching the riser, pulled UP: its
side lands flat against the riser. That strip is inside the solid now, so
the riser loses it and the side is never built — the classic result. The riser
used to stay as an «interior partition» with the side standing on it, and
the guard refused the pull; with that fixed, the riser and the tread (both
U-shaped now) were probed from their vertex average, which sits in the
notch, and got marked interior — a closed solid 2.3 m³ short."""
