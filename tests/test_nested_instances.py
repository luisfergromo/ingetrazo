"""Nested placements: a component keeps the internal sharing the .skp gave it.

The hedge in ``piscina`` is 9600 stored faces placed 48 times inside its own
definition. Flattening that on import produced 230400 real faces — 89% of the
model, 24x over — which is why our .skp came out at 80 MB against the
original's 14. These tests pin the contract that fixes it: the geometry is
stored ONCE and placed by matrix, while the user still sees (and clicks) ONE
object.
