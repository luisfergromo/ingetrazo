"""The automatic orientation pass must not move paint to the other side.

Marco, 2026-09-18, on seeing a blue face turn white after a push: «¿qué
pasa si tengo una casa con paredes, texturas exteriores diferentes a las
interiores, hago push de adentro? ¿La textura cambiaría?»

It would have. ``orient_outward`` fixed a wrong winding by reversing the
loop, and paint lives by side — the front's in ``attrs``, the back's own in
``attrs["back"]`` — so the front's plaster went to the street and the
brick came indoors. Now a face painted on BOTH sides keeps each paint on
the side it was; only the winding turns. A face painted on one side keeps
following the correction (a painted rectangle pulled into a box must come
out painted underneath too).
