"""An acquired point keeps guiding you once you have started drawing.

Marco, screen recording of 2026-09-18, drawing the step of exercise 18 along
a wall: «quiero dibujar un rectángulo en el suelo agarrado de las dos
esquinas del muro, en la segunda esquina está la referencia pero al momento
de jalar el rectángulo se pierde la referencia».

The plane was right and the corner was found — the recording shows
«Intersección» with its green X at 6.43 x 0.00 m. Pulling out to give the
step its depth, the length slid to 6.37: nothing held it to the corner.

Measured with the corner acquired and the same cursor:

    before the first click     from_point   x = 6.430
    rectangle under way        none         x = 6.370

The machinery was built and working. It was locked away behind
``start_point is None`` at exactly the moment he needed it, and the classic
inference offers it mid-operation too.

WHERE it was opened is the whole safety argument. Rule 5d sits ABOVE the
named points, so unlocking it in place would have let an alignment line
outrank a midpoint or the origin — precedence that is not ours to spend.
The mid-operation call is a second one, further down, competing only with
the soft axis cue. Over the 114,048-cell grid: 1368 cells changed, every one
of them into ``from_point``, none of them without an acquired point, and not
one named point overridden.

    quiero dibujar una línea, dibujo sale desfasada»). Reading his scene
    through the bridge: the line ran 2.2390 → 6.2390, so its middle is
    4.2390, and his click had landed at 4.2670, leaving halves of 2.0280
    and 1.9720.

    He had acquired the line's own left END, whose alignment line runs
    straight along the line itself — so it covered the midpoint for the
    whole length. Reproduced with his exact geometry and camera:

        one end acquired     from_point   0.65 cm
