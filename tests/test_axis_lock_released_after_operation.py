"""The arrow-key axis lock lasts one operation, not until Esc (issue #30).

@pacaeiro: «In SK, if you're drawing a line and press Arrow to lock X and
finish drawing the line, the X lock is released automatically. In ingeTrazo
the Axis lock keeps active (it can be released with an Escape key, not a big
deal). If we are trying to somewhat mimic SK, it's a detail to consider.»

It is more than a detail: the lock outlived the line it was for, so the
NEXT line silently came out constrained to the same axis, and the label
stayed on screen claiming a state the user had finished with.

Same shape as the Alt toggle in issue #26 — a mode meant to last one
operation that lasted the session — and released at the same three places
an operation can end: a click that commits, a stroke released, a typed
value applied. The Down-arrow reference is deliberately left alone: it is
bound to an edge the user went and picked.

    This test used to assert the opposite — that the lock survives the
    second click — and that was my reading, not the real behaviour. The first fix
    released the lock when the OPERATION ended, and for the Line tool the
    operation is the whole polyline, because it chains. He means the
    moment the line EXISTS. He draws this way every day; the test was
    encoding my guess over his measurement.
