"""A layer switched off in the .skp arrives switched off.

openskp's ``Layer`` carries ``hidden``; the adapter asked it for
``visible``, which no generation of the library has ever had. So
``getattr(ly, "visible", True)`` fell through to its default on every file
and EVERY imported layer landed visible, whatever the author had turned
off.

Found on 2026-09-17 with Rafael's ``edificio.skp``: the file hides
``Camera_FOV_Lines`` and ``Camera_FOV_Volume``, so the original program shows a
small camera glyph and nothing else. IngeTrazo drew the whole camera frustum
across the model — Marco spotted it comparing screenshots side by side.

Not a regression from the openskp 1.3.0 repin: the old pinned version
spelled it ``hidden`` too. It had simply never worked.
