"""The .skp writer must survive a CLASSIC group nested in a container.

A group that owns its geometry has no ``xform``: its mesh is already in the
coordinates its parent expects — that is what "classic" means, as opposed
to an instance, which is a shared prototype plus a matrix. ``_placement``
handed that ``None`` straight to ``_instance_placement``, which reads rows
off it, so exporting a container with such a child died with
``AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'row'``.

Found on 2026-09-17 exporting Marco's own Plaza Yanque to .skp — «Group 8»,
a classic group with a mesh, sitting inside a container. His flagship model
could not be exported to .skp at all.

For a classic child the right placement is the IDENTITY: there is nothing
to transform, the geometry is where it says it is.
