"""Alt cycles the linear inferences DURING an operation, the classic way.

@pacaeiro, on 0.4.2 (issue #26): «I finally discovered that ALT key switch
off some inferences (witch is very good), but the problem is the ALT key
itself. In my daily job I use a lot the shortcuts ALT and ALT+TAB to switch
between programs, and every time I do that with ingeTrazo I lost the
inferences.»

The key is right — Marco's reference screenshot reads «Alt =
Activar/desactivar "Inferencias lineales" (Ninguno activo)», the same three
states we cycle. What was wrong is WHEN: the convention offers it only after the
first click of a line, and we had it global, at any idle moment. So an
Alt+Tab with nothing in progress moved a mode he was not even using.

Gated on an operation being under way, his daily window switching cannot
touch it: idle, there is nothing to steal.

The first attempt cycled on the RELEASE of a clean tap instead, and he
tested it from main: «sometimes it triggers the command, some other do
not». Measured on Marco's desktop with an application-level probe — the
Alt release is what makes Qt's menu bar take focus, so it lands on the
QMenuBar and the focus ping-pongs. One tap in six reached the viewport.
Hence: act on the PRESS, and swallow the release so the menu bar never
takes it.
