"""The third axis, the one the work plane cannot offer (issue #31).

@pacaeiro: «in certain viewport positions, is impossible to get Inference
of the 3 axis (X, Y, Z)».

Measured over the whole camera grid before changing anything (11 cameras ×
72 directions, harness in ``scripts/probe_snap_matrix.py``): every camera
reached exactly TWO axes and never three — x/y from the top, x/z from the
front, y/z from the side, and one oblique managed only one. It is geometry,
not a threshold wanting widening: the cursor becomes a world point by
landing on the work plane, the world-space detector compares directions in
that same space, and a plane holds at most two of the three axes.

The screen-space detector is consulted ONLY where the world one found
nothing, so the two axes a camera already offered keep coming from the path
they always came from. That is the safety property, and it is by
construction rather than by promise: over the 57,024-cell grid the only
transition that appeared was ``none → axis``, 633 of them, all on the Line
tool, with zero cells that already held an axis moving.
