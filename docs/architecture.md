# IngeTrazo architecture

This is an early-stage document. Expect it to grow as the codebase does.

## High-level layout

## Rendering pipeline

The 3D viewport uses **QOpenGLWidget** (PySide6) as the Qt-managed surface
with direct OpenGL 3.3 Core calls (`QOpenGLShaderProgram`, `QOpenGLBuffer`,
VAOs). Shaders live in `resources/shaders/` and are selected by the `styles/`
modules (Default, Architectural, Shaded, Hidden Line, Monochrome, Wireframe,
X-ray).

## Scene graph

The scene is a flat list of primitives (edges, faces, groups) managed by
`core/scene.py`. Groups and components provide hierarchy; editing a group
swaps the active mesh context. The topology layer (`core/topology.py`) keeps
the shared-vertex mesh consistent, and the hermeticity guard in Push/Pull
refuses to commit a broken solid.

## Plugin system

See [plugins.md](plugins.md).
