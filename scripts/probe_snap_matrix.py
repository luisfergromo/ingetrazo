"""Freeze what the snap engine answers today, so a change has to prove it
did not move anything it was not meant to move.

The safety net for issue #31's second part (see
``~/Proyectos/ingetrazo/inferencia-pantalla/plan.md``). The inference runs
on every mouse move and decides where every click lands; months of tuning
sit in it — the sticky acquired edge, the origin beating the axis line, the
arrow locks, the hover plane, excluding the geometry being dragged. A
careless change there does not fail a test, it makes drawing *feel* wrong,
and by then it is too late to measure.

So: walk a grid of camera × cursor × tool × Alt state × scene, ask the
REAL path (``Viewport._refresh_snap``, not ``compute_snap`` in a vacuum, so
the work plane, the neighbourhood and the lock-line projection are all in
play), and write one line per cell. Record it on main, change something,
run it again, diff. Cells that moved and should not have are the bug.

    scripts/probe_snap_matrix.py -o base.jsonl
    # …change something…
    scripts/probe_snap_matrix.py -o after.jsonl
    diff <(sort base.jsonl) <(sort after.jsonl)

It must reproduce itself byte for byte on two consecutive runs, or it is
not a baseline. ``--selftest`` checks exactly that.

#: With nothing around, and with a corner to compete against — the named
#: point snaps must keep beating the axis, and only the second scene can
#: show it.
#: The third, "midline", was added 2026-09-18 and is the one that matters
#: most: a 4 m edge whose LEFT END is the acquired point, so its midpoint
#: lies on that point's own alignment line. That is Marco's case, and until
#: this scene existed the grid could not express it — it reported zero
#: changes for a fix whose effect had just been measured by hand twice.
#: A net proves nothing about a shape it cannot hold.
#: The fourth, "walls", was added 2026-09-19 for Rafael's window (02:20 of
#: his second review): a corner encouraged on ONE wall and the cursor on
#: ANOTHER — perpendicular or opposite — at that corner's height. Every
#: earlier scene was flat, so no cell of any earlier baseline ever had a
#: vertical face under the cursor with a reference on a different plane.
#: The last three, 2026-09-23, for issue #44 (local axes): a group, a
#: component and a subgroup inside a container, each TURNED 30° about Z and
#: 20° about X and open for editing, with a face and an edge of their own
#: near the start point. Until they existed no cell ever drew inside a
#: turned context, so the grid could not tell world axes from local ones.

#:
#: 170 px was added 2026-09-18, after the grid reported ZERO changes for a
#: fix whose effect had just been measured by hand. The ring is centred on
#: the start point at the origin and the competing geometry sits 1.5 m out,
#: which at this camera is ~90 px: the cursor barely reached it, so an
#: acquired-point alignment and a midpoint never actually competed. Third
#: time this net has had to be widened — it proves nothing it cannot reach.
RADII_PX = (30.0, 90.0, 170.0)

#: With and without a point the user has hovered and left. Added 2026-09-18:
#: the grid cleared it on every cell, so it measured nothing about the
#: acquired-point rules — and those are exactly what Marco's rectangle needs
#: («en la segunda esquina está la referencia pero al momento de jalar el
#: rectángulo se pierde la referencia»). A baseline that cannot see a rule
#: cannot protect it.
#: The third, 2026-09-19, sits 1.2 m up on the "walls" scene's front wall:
#: an acquired point OFF the plane the cursor is on, which the point on
#: the ground could never be.
ACQUIRED = (None, (2.0, 1.0, 0.0), (0.5, -1.5, 1.2))

#: Before the first click, and with an operation under way. Added
#: 2026-09-18 and the biggest hole of the four: ``_reset_tool`` always gave
#: the tool a start point, so every cell of every earlier baseline measured
#: the SECOND half of a gesture. Marco's midpoint bug lives in the first
#: click, and the grid reported zero changes for its fix three times
#: running while a hand measurement showed 0.65 cm moving to 0.00.
STARTED = (True, False)

#: The directional locks, with an operation under way (they need a start
#: point, so the first-click cells skip them). Added 2026-09-19 for issue
#: #34 (@pacaeiro: references not always found under a lock): rules 1 and
#: 1.5 of the engine — the arrow-key lock and the Shift lock — had never
#: been in a single cell, because ``_reset_tool`` clears both. The Shift
#: lock is set the way ``_capture_shift_lock`` leaves it, along +X.
#: (Rule 3, Shift held over a soft axis cue, reads the keyboard and stays
#: out of reach here; its tests cover it.)
