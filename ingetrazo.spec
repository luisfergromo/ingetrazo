"""PyInstaller spec for IngeTrazo.

Produces (one-dir mode):
- Windows: dist\\ingetrazo\\  (ingetrazo.exe + DLLs + _internal resources)
- Linux:   dist/ingetrazo/   (binary + libs)

Build:
    pyinstaller ingetrazo.spec --noconfirm

The same spec works on every platform (mirrors ingepresupuestos.spec in the
sibling repo). Runtime resource lookups are repo-root-relative
(``Path(__file__).parents[1] / "resources"``), which in the frozen one-dir
layout resolves inside ``_internal/`` — so every data destination below
mirrors the repo layout exactly.

Rendering note (Windows): Qt 6 picks desktop OpenGL and falls back to the
bundled software rasterizer (``opengl32sw.dll``, shipped by the PySide6
wheel) when the driver can't give a 3.3 core context — both paths satisfy
the viewport's requirements, no forcing needed.

# ── The X client libraries come from the HOST, never from here ───────────────
# Bundling libX11 puts a SECOND copy of it in the process: Qt loads ours
# through $ORIGIN while the host's GL driver loads the system one, and the
# Display of one is not the Display of the other. Mesa tolerates it; NVIDIA
# does not, and the packaged builds die at start-up with
#   qt.glx: qglx_findConfig: Failed to finding matching FBConfig
#   Could not initialize GLX
# (issue #6 — the tarball and the AppImage fail on an NVIDIA + X11 machine
# where the same tag from source works). Note that `libxcb.so.1` was never
# bundled, which is what makes the split possible in the first place.
#
# Only these three go: they are on every system that can draw a window at
# all, and every one of them is also loaded by the host's GL driver. The
# other libxcb-* helpers stay — Qt's xcb plugin needs them and a minimal
# host may not have them.
#
# 2026-09-15, issue #6 again (v0.3.19, NVIDIA + Ubuntu 24.04): with the X
# libraries gone the bundle still aborts inside Qt's GLX integration while
# the same tag from pip PySide6 runs — so the culprit is something else the
# bundle carries and pip does not. The C++ runtime: PyInstaller ships the
# build runner's ``libstdc++.so.6`` / ``libgcc_s.so.1`` (Ubuntu 22.04,
# GLIBCXX ≤ 3.4.30) and they are loaded FIRST, so a driver library that
# was built against a newer runtime fails to load and GLX has no vendor
# to talk to. The AppImage exclude list has carried both for years for
# exactly that reason («Workaround for: libstdc++.so.6: version
# GLIBCXX_3.4.21 not found»); every desktop has a runtime at least as
# new as the runner's, which is all the bundled Qt needs — the pip wheels
# never bring their own either. ``libglib-2.0.so.0`` goes for the same
# reason: the host's GIO modules (gvfs, loaded through the platform theme)
# expect the host's GLib, and the bundled older one produced the
# ``g_task_set_static_name`` noise in every report.
