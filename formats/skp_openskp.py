"""Adapter: an OpenSKP parse → an IngeTrazo geometry payload.

Kept in its own module so ``import openskp`` happens lazily (only when this
backend actually runs) — ``formats/skp.py`` must stay importable without the
optional parser installed.

OpenSKP 0.8-era data model (v0.2.0), discovered by introspection:

* ``SkpFile.open(path).parse()`` → ``SkpModel`` with ``definitions`` (dict:
  id → ``Definition``), ``materials``, ``layers``, ``version``.
* ``Definition``: ``id``, ``name``, ``vertices`` (dict id → ``Vertex(x,y,z)``),
  ``edges`` (dict id → ``Edge(v1_id, v2_id)``), ``faces`` (dict id → ``Face``),
  ``instances`` (list of ``Instance``).
* ``Face``: ``loops`` — a list of loops, each ``[(edge_id, sense), …]``; the
  first loop is the outer boundary, the rest are holes. Plus ``normal`` and
  ``material_id``. ``sense`` is NOT read: what it holds changed between
  OpenSKP releases, so ``_ring_raw`` walks the loop's connectivity instead.
* ``Instance``: ``matrix`` (a 3×3 rotation/scale row-major + a translation, 13
  floats), ``ref_idx`` (→ the placed definition's id), ``children``.

The .skp format stores lengths in **inches** and is **Z-up** — same up axis as
IngeTrazo, so we only scale (inches → metres); no axis swap. The instance tree
is flattened to world-space polygons (reference geometry, like the big-DAE
import path). Per-face materials resolve through ``SkpModel.materials_by_id``
(our upstream PR iamahsanmehmood/openskp#3): plain colours become
``attrs["color"]``, and textured materials (``Material.texture``, PR openskp#4)
become ``attrs["texture"]`` — image bytes extracted to the app's texture cache
(see :func:`_texture_dir`), tile size in metres, rendered with IngeTrazo's planar projection
(the .skp format's default texture behaviour; per-face UVs from the TLV are a
later refinement). Both joins are guarded, so PyPI 0.2.0 still imports (uncoloured).

    tuples in INCHES. Returns ``None`` on any dangling reference.

    The ring is read from the loop's CONNECTIVITY — each coedge contributes
    the vertex it shares with the next one — and NOT from ``sense``, because
    OpenSKP changed what that flag carries. It used to be the .skp format's
    own storage bit (0 = forward, 1 = reversed); upstream 0cd14d7 normalized it
    to the documented +1 / -1, and under ±1 BOTH values are truthy, so a
    boolean test silently took the same endpoint for every coedge. Every
    polygon with a reversed coedge then came out as a self-intersecting star:
    plaza Yanque lost 68% of its surface (43008 → 13590 m², same faces, same
    bounding box) and drew as spikes across the whole terrain.

    Consecutive coedges connect head-to-tail under either encoding, so each
    coedge ENDS at the vertex it shares with the next one — which is the very
    vertex the flag used to select, so a parser on either contract now yields
    the identical ring (verified corner-for-corner over a 116k-face file).
