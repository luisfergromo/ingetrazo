"""SKP import seam — IngeTrazo's own reader, behind one seam.

IngeTrazo aims to open **any** ``.skp`` (old → recent). This module is the
single seam between IngeTrazo and *how* an ``.skp`` is read, so the parser can
evolve independently of the app. The backend is **OpenSKP**
(https://github.com/iamahsanmehmood/openskp, MIT) or a maintained fork: pure
Python, offline, no Wine, no proprietary code. (Until 2026-09-28 a second
path ran a proprietary SDK through the former external converter for files
the reader could not open; it has been removed.)

**Parse then apply.** A backend *parses* a file into a plain **payload** (world-
space face loops, no ``Scene`` touched). The heavy parse runs outside the undo
history; :func:`apply_payload` then adds the geometry cheaply inside a command.
When no backend can produce geometry, :func:`parse_skp` raises
:class:`NeedsConverter` before any mutation and the UI says the file could
not be read -- so a failed parse never leaves a half-applied edit.

Nothing here imports a parser at module load — a missing OpenSKP is just an
unavailable backend.
