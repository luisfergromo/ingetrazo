"""DWG → DXF bridge through the LibreDWG satellite (D3).

DWG is never parsed inside the app: the LibreDWG ``dwg2dxf`` command-line
tool runs as an external converter — the same satellite pattern the
former external converter used, and a straight port of IngeCAD's
``formats/dwg_bridge.py``, scars included. The user double-clicks a
``.dwg`` and never sees the DXF.

Search order for the tool: the bundle shipped with IngeTrazo
(``vendor/libredwg/bin``), the system PATH, and — a development-machine
courtesy — the sibling IngeCAD checkout's bundle, so the two projects
share one built LibreDWG. The build reads DWG up to r2018, which is the
format every AutoCAD from 2018 through 2026 writes.

The two DXF repairs are the price of LibreDWG 0.14's output and ezdxf's
strictness, both documented in IngeCAD where they were first paid:
``_strip_null_handles`` (ENDBLK entities with handle 0, rejected even by
recover mode) and ``_dedupe_handles`` (reused handles that make ezdxf
lose the whole drawing when ``*Model_Space``'s is stolen — reported
upstream as LibreDWG#1356).
