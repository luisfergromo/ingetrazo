"""Native IngeTrazo document format (``.igz``).

Plain JSON, schema-versioned. Trivial to inspect, edit by hand, and diff
in source control. Will grow as new entity types (faces, groups,
components, materials) land — old documents must keep loading.

Layout::

    {
      "igz_format": 1,
      "app_version": __version__,
      "scene": {
        "edges": [
          {"a": [x, y, z], "b": [x, y, z]},
          ...
        ],
        "faces": [
          {"vertices": [[x, y, z], ...]}
        ]
      }
    }

**Textured documents are ZIP containers** (format 2). A texture is an image
*file*, so a plain-JSON document could only point at one — an absolute path
that broke the moment the ``.igz`` travelled to another machine. When the scene
uses textures the document becomes a ZIP holding the very same JSON as
``document.json`` plus the images under ``textures/``, and each texture entry
carries ``"embed": "textures/<hash>-<name>"`` instead of ``"path"``. The
document is then **self-contained and portable**. Opening one unpacks the
images into the app's texture cache (content-addressed, so documents sharing an
image share the file and the GPU upload) and points the entries back at real
paths — the rest of the app keeps seeing ``attrs["texture"]["path"]`` and knows
nothing about containers.

Untextured documents stay **plain JSON at format 1**: the common case remains
diffable, hand-editable, and readable by older builds. ``load_into`` sniffs the
ZIP magic, so both shapes open transparently.
