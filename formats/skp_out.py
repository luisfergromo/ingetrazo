"""SKP export — native .skp file via OpenSKP's pure-Python writer.

Writes the scene as a legacy-format (v17) ``.skp`` file, readable wherever
.skp files of the 2017 version or later open — no COLLADA round-trip, no
external SDK, no Wine. Per-face paint (``Face.attrs["color"]``) becomes a
.skp material, textured faces (``attrs["texture"]``) become image-mapped
materials with their original textures embedded in the ``.skp``, layers
become .skp tags, and face holes survive as inner loops.

Structure survives too: a classic group (mesh in world coordinates, no
``xform``) becomes a .skp group via ``add_group``, and component instances
— sibling groups sharing one prototype mesh — become ONE component definition
placed by N instances (``add_component_definition`` + ``add_instance``), so
the shared geometry is stored once and stays editable as a component on the
reading side. Loose mesh faces stay root-level. Hidden entities are not
exported (mirroring ``meshexport.world_faces``); face-me figures become
components in the .skp format's face-me convention (``_billboard_definition``).

Coordinates are in **inches** (the .skp native unit); the model's metre-based
geometry is scaled by ``_M_TO_IN``, and instance placements carry their
rotation/scale 3×3 unchanged with the translation converted the same way.
The file produced is the same legacy MFC format that ``openskp.create``
targets — pre-2021, universally readable.

      (Z × n, n × Z × n): every pinned face came out turned by the angle of
      its first edge. A palm trunk of thousands of quads, each with its own
      first edge, arrived shattered.
    * ``"unscaled pins"`` — a .skp keeps that matrix in INCHES of texture
      space, divided by the material's applied size on reading; the
      writer stores the pins' tile-unit UVs as given. Marco's pool water

      openskp's own ``edit`` module dodges this by writing applied size 1.0

      rely on the real size.

    Both measured through the former external converter (2026-09-04,

    10 in, pinned to ``u = x/10, v = y/10``, and reads the stored matrix
    back with openskp's parser (calibrated against real files): a correct

    the face's SPAN) and our vertices are float32, so a small face far from
    the origin inherits the rounding of a big number and is refused: 15516 of
    the 75486 faces of Marco's pool, each then written as a fan of triangles
    (+18k face records, and the edges that come with them). Snapping each
    face onto its own best-fit plane fixes the test and costs more: it moves
    corners PER FACE, so neighbours stop sharing vertices and every shared
    edge gets written twice (measured: 169878 edges -> 222473, file 28.7 ->
    30.8 MB). The tolerance wants to scale with coordinate magnitude rather
    than face span — an OpenSKP matter. Until then a rejected polygon falls
    back to triangulation: ``face.triangulate()`` is hole-aware, triangles
    are coplanar by definition, and the original corners are kept, so the
    welding survives.

    Pins go only with a material that was written TEXTURED (``applied``
    knows which): an image that fell back to a colour has nothing to
    position, and the fallback triangles get their own pins, fitted on the
    triangle the writer sees.

    Each side gets what it wears here, and the .skp shows the same:
    ``attrs["back"]`` as a dict is the back's own material and pins,
    ``True`` a two-sided face (the front's material and pins again), and an
    absent back is the .skp default back — unless the front is

    there (``core.materials.back_is_default``, the renderer's rule). Until
