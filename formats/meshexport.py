Both formats need the same three things OBJ already does: every renderable face
in **world** coordinates, triangulated and grouped by its material (a solid
``Face.attrs["color"]`` or a textured ``attrs["texture"]``), plus the per-vertex
UVs from the same planar/affine projection the viewport and OBJ use — so a model
exported to any of these formats looks identical. Kept here so glTF and DAE stay
in lock-step and don't each re-derive the material grouping.
