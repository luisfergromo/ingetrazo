"""Topology helpers — graph queries over the scene's edge network.

Used by tools (today: ``LineTool``) to find polygons that close when a new
edge is added. Modeled after the classic behaviour: as soon as a new edge
completes a planar cycle in the edge graph — using any combination of
existing edges — that cycle becomes a face automatically.

Position equality is tolerant: two vertices within ``_KEY_DECIMALS``
decimal places (≈ 0.1 mm at metric scale) are treated as the same node.
