"""Imported reference images (``File ▸ Import ▸ image``).

An image plane is a textured rectangle you trace over: a scanned floor plan, a
survey sketch, a facade photo. It is **reference, never geometry** — invariant
#4 of the project: display-only entities never enter the topology engine, so an
image is not a face, is never welded, healed, pushed or exported as a mesh. It
lives in ``Scene.image_planes`` beside guides and survey points.

Geometry is stored as a corner plus two edge vectors, so the same three fields
carry position, size *and* orientation on any plane:

    origin ───u───▶ (origin+u)
      │
      v
      ▼
    (origin+v)      (origin+u+v)

``u`` runs along the image's width and ``v`` along its height; the length of
each **is** the real-world size in metres, so scaling is just re-deriving the
two vectors. ``aspect`` (pixel height / pixel width) lets the placement tool
keep the picture undistorted while the user drags.

# translated one: layer names are document data.
