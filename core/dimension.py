"""Linear dimension — a measured annotation between two world points.

A ``Dimension`` records two endpoints ``a``/``b`` and an ``offset`` vector
giving where the dimension line sits relative to the measured segment.

An endpoint placed ON a vertex is **anchored** to it (a dimension belongs to
the geometry it measures): the endpoint reads the vertex's
position live, so scaling, moving or stretching the drawing takes the
dimension along and re-measures it — the first thing a user of DriveMeca's
video missed (2026-09-20, Marco: «dibujamos algo, lo acotamos, después lo
escalamos y la acotación se queda allí, no se redimensiona con el dibujo
y no se actualiza la nueva medición»). A vertex inside a component reads
through its placement's transform, so moving the instance moves the
dimension too. When the vertex is gone (erased, welded away) the endpoint
freezes where it last was. An endpoint snapped to a midpoint, an edge or a
face has no vertex to hold and stays static.

It is an annotation, not geometry: it lives in ``Scene.dimensions`` and is
drawn as a screen-space overlay (extension lines + dimension line + value
label), not in the mesh.

Two kinds, the usual convention: **aligned** (``axis`` is None) — the dimension
line parallel to a–b, measuring its length — and **linear** (``axis`` is
``"x"``/``"y"``/``"z"``) — the dimension line parallel to that axis,
measuring the segment's extent along it, the extension lines square to the
axis. A slanted line dimensioned by pulling the cursor to its SIDE gives
the vertical extent, pulling ABOVE gives the horizontal one, pulling square
off the line gives the aligned length (@pacaeiro, issue #50: «the Dimension
tool should be able to measure aligned (as it does now), but also linear»).
