"""Sheet compositions — printing the model as a plan, at exact scale.

QGIS-composer-shaped (see docs/composer-plan.md): a ``Composicion`` is a
paper page with items on it; the central item is a ``MarcoVista`` — a frame
that references a view (a saved scene, a standard view or the live camera)
plus a 1:N scale, and is filled by rendering the model with a parallel
camera through the viewport's own pipeline.

This module is headless on purpose (no Qt imports): the geometry of paper
and the scale math live here so they are testable without a GL context.
Model units are METRES; composer units are MILLIMETRES of paper.
