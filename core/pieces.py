"""Split a group into its physical pieces: the solids that do not touch.

What a model file calls its parts is often not what a person would. A Sweet
Home 3D bar stool is 43 groups in its OBJ, and they are surface fragments —
cut wherever the material changes — while the stool itself is five things
you could pick up: the seat with its back, a footrest, a front frame and two
side legs. And a kitchen cabinet is the opposite case: its carcase boards
are separate closed boxes that TOUCH, and once the import welds coincident
corners, plain connectivity reads the whole carcase as one piece.

So a piece is found in two passes (:func:`solid_parts`). First the solids:
around every edge, each face is paired with the face it meets turning into
the material behind it (:func:`_edge_partners`) — on an ordinary edge that
is simply the other face, and where two boards meet (four faces, or six at
a corner) it is the face of the same board, never the neighbour's. A result
counts as a solid when it closes, has thickness and at least four faces. Then the fragments (open patches, zero-thickness strips,
what a file cut by material leaves) cluster through shared vertices and
join the one solid most of their corners lie on; a fragment that only
brushes a solid at a corner or two — a counter top resting on the carcase —
stays a piece of its own. A fragment never bridges two solids.
