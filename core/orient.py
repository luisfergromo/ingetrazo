"""Consistent outward orientation for closed solids in the non-manifold mesh.

The root-fix invariant: every face of a closed solid is wound so its normal
points *outward* from the enclosed volume. The solid push/pull pipeline relies
on it at both ends — it orients **on entry** (hand-built or loaded meshes can
arrive with mixed winding) so the naive extrude's deterministic quad winding
and the per-plane rebuild's material-side classification (:mod:`core.
cap_rebuild`) can trust face normals, and **on exit** so every committed solid
upholds the invariant for the next edit.

The mesh is **shared-vertex, non-manifold** (an interior wall is shared by two
rooms; an edge can border three faces), so winding does *not* propagate cleanly
through half-edges — there is no single "the other face across this edge". So
orientation is decided **per face, independently**, by parity ray casting: a
point just off a face along its normal is *outside* the solid iff a ray from it
crosses the rest of the mesh an even number of times. That is robust to
non-manifold edges and needs no seed face.

Only meaningful for a **closed** component (no boundary edges). Flat drawings and
open sheets have no inside/outside, so the entry points no-op on them.
