"""Planar arrangement: rebuild the minimal faces of a plane from its edges.

Given a tangle of segments lying in one plane (hand-drawn walls, slivers,
crossings, T-junctions, doubled lines), recompute the *minimal bounded faces* —
the robust, deterministic replacement for the heuristic heal pass.

Classic DCEL face extraction:

1. Project the segments to the plane's 2D coordinates.
2. Split every segment at its intersections / overlaps with the others, snapping
   endpoints to a quantised grid so coincident points become one vertex.
3. Prune dangling (degree-1) chains — they border no face.
4. At each vertex, sort the outgoing half-edges by angle; trace each face by
   always taking the *next edge clockwise* (interior kept on the left), which
   yields bounded faces wound CCW and the unbounded face wound CW.
5. Keep the CCW cycles as faces; nest each CW cycle (a hole) inside the smallest
   CCW face that contains it; drop the one CW cycle that contains everything
   (the unbounded outer face).

The result is returned in 3D as ``(outer_loop, [hole_loops])`` per face, ready to
hand to ``AddFaceCommand``. Self-overlapping pathologies aside, this is exact for
the room/notch/hole geometry a floor plan is made of.
