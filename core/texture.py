"""Image textures, mapped the .skp way for interchange compatibility.

A .skp material is a colour plus an optional texture image with a
**real-world tile size** (the model-unit width/height one repeat of the image
covers). The default mapping is a **planar projection**: a face's UVs come from
its world position projected onto the face plane, divided by the tile size. The
projection basis depends only on the face normal — the .skp format's own, see
:func:`projection_basis` — so coplanar faces share it and the texture tiles
**seamlessly** across a flat surface, and a face painted here shows the image
where the .skp file places it.

A textured face carries ``attrs["texture"] = {"path", "sw", "sh"}``. Colour and
texture are independent (a face can have either or both).

``path`` is always a real file on disk (the renderer, and every exporter, load
the image from there). Images that came in *inside* something — extracted from
an imported ``.skp``, unpacked from an ``.igz`` container — live in the app's
own **texture cache** (:func:`texture_cache_root`), never next to the user's
files.

# ``SHIFT`` moves every pixel by the delta between the image average and the

# and saturation outright and keeps only the per-pixel lightness.
#
# This lived in ``formats.skp_openskp`` when the only caller was the .skp
# import. It is engine, not import: the material editor tints from here too,
# and the importer now calls in.
