"""Construction guides (Tape Measure) — guide lines and points.

A guide is scaffolding, not geometry: an infinite dashed construction line (or a
lone point) used to align real drawing. It never enters the topology mesh; it
lives in ``Scene.guides``, renders as a fine dashed overlay, and feeds the snap
engine so drawing tools can lock onto it — that is its whole purpose.
