"""Deterministic plane rebuild for push/pull (the root-fix, "path C").

This is what replaced the fragile post-extrude heal chain — the old
``_extrude_commands`` case tree (extend-wall / notch / strip), the
``cap_boundary_loops`` crack patcher, and the winding-tolerant coplanar merge
on solids — with one deterministic recompute per touched plane:

1. Gather the mesh edges lying on the plane.
2. Run the planar arrangement (:mod:`core.arrangement`) to get every minimal
   bounded region.
3. Classify each region by **which side of the plane holds material**,
   volumetrically: parity ray-casting (the same primitive as
   :func:`core.orient.orient_outward`) from a sample point just off the
   region's interior on each side. Reading the volume keeps the answer
   independent of the order planes are rebuilt in — the overlapping coplanar
   faces a naive extrude leaves mid-cleanup cancel in crossing-parity pairs.
   Material on exactly **one** side → a boundary face (wound toward the empty
   side); on neither → a phantom outside the solid; on both → solid interior
   (e.g. the mouth ring where a pushed-out pane meets its wall — facing it
   would create an internal partition and swallow a window hole).
4. Union each side's regions (dropping the edges interior to the union) into
   the final face loops — outer boundary plus holes.

The headline win: a push that touched a plane just rebuilds that plane's faces
from its edges, instead of patching geometry with a growing tree of special
cases.
