"""3D Text — real, editable geometry generated from font glyphs (Texto
3D).

Qt supplies the glyph outlines (``QPainterPath.addText`` →
``toSubpathPolygons``); each outline ring is classified outer/hole by
containment parity, becomes a front face (with holes) and, when a thickness
is given, a back face plus side walls — one closed solid per contour group.
The result is a plain ``Mesh`` for a ``Group``: the letters push/pull, paint
and export like anything drawn by hand.

:func:`make_text_group` is what the app inserts: a container group with ONE
NESTED GROUP PER LETTER (Rafael, 2026-09-16: «que cada letra aparezca como
grupo»), carrying the parameters it was made from in
``Group.text3d`` so the text stays EDITABLE — the right-click's «Edit 3D
Text…» reopens the dialog and :func:`rebuild_text_group` lays the letters
out again in place (double-click keeps its usual meaning: it enters).

The text STANDS UP by default: width along +X, height along +Z (base at
z=0), thickness along +Y — so placing it with the component-placement tool
plants the sign on the ground plane.
