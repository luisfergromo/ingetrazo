"""Insert another IngeTrazo document into the open one, as ONE component.

Like importing a .skp file: the whole file arrives as a single
component you place with a click — a pergola, an arch, a lamp post drawn
in their own files, brought into the plaza («quiero agregar mobiliario
que ya había trabajado como pérgolas, arco, luminaria… son archivos .igz»,
Marco, 2026-09-11).

What the file holds becomes the component's tree, nothing gets baked: its
loose geometry is the container's own mesh, its groups (with their own
children and matrices) its children — face-me sprites included (the torito
on the arch came with the arch). Only the app's own scale figure is left
behind: in a furniture file it is a reference, not furniture. A file that
is exactly one group inserts as that group.

Materials and layers cross over by name: a material whose name is taken
by a DIFFERENT recipe registers under "name (2)" and the faces that wear
it are restamped (see :func:`core.materials.register`); layers the file
uses and the document lacks are created, visible.
