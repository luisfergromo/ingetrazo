"""Edit operations that turn drawn segments into history commands.

This is the bridge between the pure geometry planner in :mod:`core.topology`
and the undo/redo commands in :mod:`core.history`. Tools hand it the raw
segments the user drew; it returns a single reversible command that:

- splits existing edges the new segments cross (the classic auto-split),
- breaks each new segment at those crossings,
- welds coincident edges (via ``AddEdgeCommand``'s merge), and
- optionally auto-faces any planar cycle the new sub-edges close.

Segments are processed in order against a running simulation of the scene's
edge list, so a batch (e.g. a rectangle's four edges) splits correctly even
when later segments cross edges created by earlier ones.

Kept in its own module to avoid an import cycle: ``history`` imports
``topology``, so the command-building glue can't live in either of them.
