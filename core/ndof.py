"""3D mouse (3Dconnexion SpaceMouse) navigation — issue #108.

A 3D mouse is a cap that can be pushed, pulled, lifted, tilted and twisted:
six axes at once. This module is the device-free half: it turns one reading
of the six axes into a camera move. The drivers that deliver the readings
live in ``views/ndof_input.py`` (spacenavd on Linux, Raw Input on Windows).

The mapping is FreeCAD's default, «object mode»: you hold the
MODEL. Move the cap right and the model goes right; lift it and the model
rises; push it away and the model goes away (zoom out); tilt it forward and
the model tips its top toward you; twist it and the model turns on its
vertical axis. The camera has no roll, so rolling the cap does nothing.

Every backend normalises its device's raw numbers into :class:`NdofSample`
first, in ONE frame — the user's — so the mapping here never cares which
driver spoke:

* ``right``   cap pushed right          (+) / left  (−)
* ``up``      cap lifted                (+) / pressed down (−)
* ``forward`` cap pushed away from you  (+) / pulled toward you (−)
* ``tilt``    cap tipped away from you  (+) (its top goes forward)
* ``spin``    cap twisted anticlockwise seen from above (+)
* ``roll``    cap tipped to the right   (+)

each in [−1, 1] at full deflection.
