"""The material registry: NAMED materials over the per-face attrs.

IngeTrazo's ground truth for pixels has always been the face itself:
``attrs["color"]`` (floats 0–1), ``attrs["texture"]`` and ``attrs["opacity"]``
ride the attrs dict, which the engine already carries across push/pull and
the plane rebuild. That stays exactly as is — the renderer and the engine
do not know this module exists.

What was missing is IDENTITY: "these 40 faces are *Concreto visto*", not
just "these 40 faces happen to be grey". A :class:`Material` gives a name
to one recipe of attrs, the scene keeps a registry of them, and a face that
was painted with a material carries ``attrs["mat"] = name`` alongside the
baked values. That one extra key — surviving face churn for free, like
every attr — is what enables:

- the .skp import to keep the .skp file's material NAMES ("Wood_Floor", not
  an anonymous colour),
- per-material quantities ("how many m² of *Tarrajeo*?"),
- editing a material once and restamping every face that wears it,
- exports that say ``Concreto_visto`` instead of ``mat0``.

The baked attrs remain authoritative for rendering: a face whose ``mat``
names a missing registry entry still renders exactly as painted — the
name is then just a label with nothing behind it.
