"""Layer / tag system: visibility and locking (tags).

A layer never *owns* geometry — it is a label an entity carries (faces via
``attrs["layer"]``, edges via their ``layer`` slot, groups via ``.layer``).
Hiding a layer removes its entities from render, picking and box selection;
locking keeps them visible but unpickable. Everything unlabelled lives on the
default layer, which always exists and cannot be removed.

This is what makes the '2D that emerges' workflow real: structure / walls /
plumbing / furniture live on their own layers of one model, and a top view in
parallel projection with the right layers on IS the plan drawing.
