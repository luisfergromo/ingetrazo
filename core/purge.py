"""Purge unused — "Purgar sin usar", for layers and materials.

A layer is a LABEL an entity carries, never its owner (see core.layers), so
deleting the geometry cannot delete the tag: the layer you empty on purpose
to refill it must survive, and undo would have to resurrect it otherwise.
What every CAD offers instead is an explicit sweep, and this is ours.

It matters most right after an import. Marco brought a surveyed plaza in as
a reference, kept one flat drawing as a guide and deleted the rest — and the
document still carried the 13 layers and 47 materials of the big drawing,
invisible (the Materials panel builds its "In model" swatches from painted
faces, not from the registry) but saved into every ``.igz`` from then on.

The traversal descends into nested placements. ``Group.children`` are real
geometry that renders, picks and exports as part of its parent, so a name
used only inside one is IN USE — a sweep that walked ``scene.groups`` as a
flat list would delete a layer out from under a component's insides.
