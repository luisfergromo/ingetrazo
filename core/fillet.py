"""Fillet (round) the edges of a solid — Rafael's «herramienta de redondeo»
(review of 2026-09-10, C3).

An edge shared by two faces is replaced by a strip of quads on the
cylinder of the given radius tangent to both faces; the faces are cut back
to the tangent lines. Where the strip ends:

* at a plain vertex with one more face (the end cap of a box edge) the
  strip is cut by that face's plane and the cap gets the arc in place of
  its corner;
* at an open end (no other face) the section is perpendicular to the edge;
* where two rounded edges meet (a chain: the rim of a slab, the rounded
  outline of a prism) both strips stop on the bisecting (mitre) plane;
* where three rounded edges meet (a box corner) each strip stops at the
  other edges' tangent distance and a spherical patch fills the corner.

Everything else — four rounded edges at a vertex, extra faces at a vertex,
a rebuilt face that would leave its plane — is refused with a reason, so
the model is never left half-cut. The result is a plan applied to the
mesh in one go (:func:`apply_fillet`), which the tool wraps in a snapshot
command. Strip seams and the tangent lines are softened so the rounding
reads as one smooth surface; the arcs on end caps are curves.
