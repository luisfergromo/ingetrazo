"""Certificates for Python's own HTTPS (``urllib``, the AI assistant).

A packaged Python looks for its CA bundle where the machine that BUILT it
kept one: the macOS package (python.org's framework build under
PyInstaller) asks for ``/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/…/cert.pem``,
which no user's Mac has, so every HTTPS call failed with
``CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`` before the server was even asked (issue
#198). Qt's network stack (map tiles, terrain, the model library) uses the
system's own store and never had the problem.

:func:`ensure_ca_bundle` leaves a working setup alone; otherwise it points
OpenSSL at ``certifi``'s bundle when present, else at the system's own file
(``/etc/ssl/cert.pem`` on macOS, the usual Linux ones), through
``SSL_CERT_FILE`` — which every new ``ssl`` context reads. Verification is
never turned off. Windows reads its certificate store directly and is left
as it is.
