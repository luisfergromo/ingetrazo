"""Follow Me sweep: extrude a profile face along an edge path.

The discrete prism-miter construction: at every path vertex a *joint plane*
is placed (normal = bisector of the incoming and outgoing directions; at open
ends, the segment direction itself). The profile's ring at each station is
obtained by sliding the previous ring parallel to the incoming segment onto
the joint plane — the exact miter, so square corners join without pinching.
Closed paths connect the last span straight back to the first ring, welding
the loop with zero seam.

Headless engine API (the AI-native action layer): the tool is a thin click
shell over :func:`sweep_profile`.
