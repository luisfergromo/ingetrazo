"""Robust polygon offset: slide the edges, let the arrangement sort out the
mess, keep the regions that are really there.

:func:`core.topology.offset_loop` slides every edge and re-intersects the
neighbours. That is exact while the result stays a polygon with the same
corners — and gives up the moment one of them disappears, because it has no
way to DROP a segment. On a real drawing that happens constantly: Marco's
paved slab, whose boundary carries the segmented bite the round plaza takes
out of it, refused any inward offset past 2.65 cm (Plaza Yanque,
2026-09-10). The classic offset does it, because it removes what
collapses.

The recipe here is the standard one, and it costs little because the hard
part already exists: :mod:`core.arrangement` computes every intersection,
traces the minimal faces and tells outer loops from holes.

1. Slide each edge by ``d``.
2. Join the corners with a MITRE, bevelling when the spike runs past the
   mitre limit (a very sharp corner would otherwise throw its offset corner
   arbitrarily far).
3. Hand the segments to the arrangement, which resolves the crossings the
   collapses create.
4. Keep the regions whose interior really sits ``d`` inside the original —
   the pockets that closed produce regions that fail this and drop out.

Step 4 is the whole trick, and it is one signed distance per region.
