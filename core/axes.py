"""The DRAWING AXES: the one red/green/blue every tool and inference reads.

At the top level they are the world's. Inside a group or component they are
that context's own axes (issue #44, @pacaeiro: «when you open a
group for editing you see its axes, not the model axes» — inferences,
arrow-key locks, the rectangle, the ground plane and the standard views all
follow them, level by level).

``AXES`` is ONE dict object, updated in place: ``core.snap._AXIS_VECTORS``,
``tools.base.PLANE_LOCK_AXES`` and the tools' own tables are the same
object, so a context switch reaches every one of them at once and nothing
can keep a stale copy. With the world frame the vectors are exactly
(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) — bit for bit what those tables held before, which
is what lets the snap harness prove the top level did not move.

The viewport calls :func:`sync` with ``scene.drawing_frame`` before it asks
the engine anything.
