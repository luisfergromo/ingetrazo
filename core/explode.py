"""Exploded view: a component's parts pulled apart, and put back.

Each part moves away from the assembly's centre in proportion to how far it
already sits from it — the classic exploded drawing, where the seat stays
put and the legs spread out around it — either in every direction
(``outward``) or along one axis only (``x``, ``y``, ``z``: a stack pulled
apart vertically reads best along blue).

The parts really move, inside their component, through an undoable command:
so everything that draws or reads the model — the viewport, section cuts,
sheets, snaps, exports — shows the exploded state with no special case.
What makes it reversible is that each part remembers the translation the
explosion gave it (``Group.explode_offset``) and the component remembers
the setting (``Group.exploded``). Changing the amount swaps the old offset
for the new one; Reassemble takes it off. A part moved by hand in between
keeps that move, because only the explosion's own share is ever undone.
