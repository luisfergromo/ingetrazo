"""The parts of a component, measured the way a cut list measures them.

A container's children are its parts (a stool split into its pieces, a
cabinet drawn board by board). For each one this module answers what the
Parts tray shows: its name, the material most of it wears, and its size as
length × width × thickness — the box a woodworker would cut it from, not
the box its axes happen to give. A leg splayed at 10° measured along the
stool's own axes is a fat diagonal; measured along its own length it is
the 4 × 4 × 58 cm stick it is.

Nothing here touches the scene: the tray reads, and every change goes
through a command.
