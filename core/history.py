"""Undo / redo history using the command pattern, over the shared-vertex mesh.

Every mutation that should be reversible goes through a :class:`Command`
subclass. The viewport owns a :class:`History` that maintains the undo and redo
stacks. Tools call ``viewport.history.execute(...)`` rather than mutating the
scene directly.

Commands mutate ``scene.mesh`` (welding, incidence) and resolve the geometry
they act on **by position at do-time**, so the position-based plans that
:mod:`core.edits` builds (against a throwaway simulation) execute correctly
onto the real mesh — and undo re-links the very objects that were removed,
preserving identity for any references other commands hold.

Why a command stack and not snapshots? Commands store only the delta, so memory
cost stays proportional to the action, not to the model size.

       into one — seeded so a deliberately drawn coplanar line elsewhere stays.

    Phases 1–2 only repair connectivity (no shape change). The splits,
    collapses and merges interact too tightly for a clean per-op inverse, so

    which is every T-junction the op can have created and none of the ones it
    found lying around — and seed phase 3.

    ``new_faces`` (when given) are the faces this operation created; phase 3 only
    fuses a coplanar component that contains one of them, so a seam a push just

    push/pull uses this: its seams are dissolved by the deterministic per-plane
    rebuild (:mod:`core.cap_rebuild`) instead of the winding-tolerant merge,
    which only remains for raw/open geometry where outwardness is undefined.

    ``dedupe=False`` skips the identical-cycle face dedupe of phase 0. The

    identical to the face it must annihilate *with*, and the per-plane rebuild

    # imported brick barbecue (3k faces, T-junctions everywhere) hung the
    # push preview for minutes per drag frame (SIGUSR1 autopsy: two stacks
    # pinned at interior_vertex_on).
    #
    # Now the sweep is ONE vectorised pass, and it is **scoped to the
    # operation**: only edges whose box meets the seed's box can be split.
    #
    # That scope is a correctness fix as much as a speed one. Sweeping every
    # edge made a push *silently re-topologise geometry it never touched* —
    # on an imported barbecue, pushing one brick split ten edges, eight of
    # them a metre away on an unrelated plane, and since a drag preview
    # reverts each frame it redid that same distant repair on every mouse
    # move. A stitch repairs what its operation disturbed; a T-junction the
    # op did not create is not its business.
    #

    # splitting vertex to lie on the edge, and either the vertex is the op's
    # (so it is in the seed box, and the edge's box must reach it) or the
    # edge is the op's (so its box is inside the seed box). Either way the
    # edge's box meets the seed box.
