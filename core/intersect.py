"""Intersect Faces (Edit ▸ Intersect Faces ▸ With Model / With
Selection / With Context): new edges wherever faces cross.

Nothing has to be a solid — this is the classic way to cut shapes
out of one another: intersect, then erase what is not wanted. The edges
land in the context being edited (outside the groups when the model is
the context, which is what makes them easy to separate), and they split
the faces of that context they run across.

The geometry: two planar faces cross along the line common to their two
planes; that line is clipped by each polygon (outer ring and holes, the
even-odd rule) and what both keep is the new edge. Coplanar faces do not
cross — nothing is drawn for them.
