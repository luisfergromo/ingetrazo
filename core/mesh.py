"""Shared-vertex, non-manifold connectivity mesh.

Level B+C of the topology-engine migration (see
``docs/halfedge-migration-plan.md``). Unlike the legacy ``core.geometry`` model
— where every ``Edge``/``Face`` stores its own *copies* of points and
connectivity is rediscovered by matching rounded positions — here a
:class:`Vertex` is a first-class **shared** object:

- an :class:`Edge` references two vertices and knows its incident faces (a
  *radial* list that may hold more than two — non-manifold is fine: three faces
  meet where two walls and a floor join);
- a :class:`Face` is bounded by loops of shared vertices, with optional holes;
- the :class:`Mesh` welds coincident positions to a single vertex on insert
  ("sticky" geometry) and maintains the incidence as geometry is added/removed.

This is the classic surface-modeller model. Moving a vertex moves every edge and face that
references it for free — no position-matching, no float tolerance.

Built in parallel with the legacy model; the app is migrated onto it
incrementally (phase M2) behind the ``Command`` facade. Nothing here is wired
into the running app yet.

    """Reverse ``face``'s winding for the automatic orientation passes —
    which must not move paint from one side of a wall to the other.

    Paint lives by side: the front's in ``attrs`` (``PAINT_KEYS``), the
    back's own in ``attrs["back"]`` (a dict), or ``True`` when the back
    mirrors the front. Reversing the loop alone moves "front" to the other
    geometric side and takes its paint along. When the BACK has paint of
    its own, the sides were painted deliberately — a house wall, brick
    outside and plaster inside, wound the wrong way — and the two paints
    trade places as the winding turns, so the street keeps its brick and
    only the face now points the right way (Marco's question, 2026-09-18).

    A face painted on ONE side keeps the old rule: the paint follows the
    front. That is what a painted rectangle pulled into a box relies on —
    the base, turned over to face down, must come out painted OUTSIDE, «a
    painted box, not a box with one painted face» (Marco, 2026-08-27). The
    two rules meet where they should: paint on both sides pins the sides;
    paint on one side goes with the correction.

    The explicit Reverse Faces command (``FlipFacesCommand``) swaps nothing,
    by design: there the material follows the front, the classic behaviour."""
