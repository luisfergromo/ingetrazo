"""One status-bar hint at a time, for the tool and the step it is in —
the classic status bar («Select objects. Shift = Add/Subtract…»), not a
strip of every shortcut at once (Marco, 2026-09-15: «mostrarlos varios al
mismo tiempo como que no es bueno»).

:func:`hint_for` answers for a tool key and its live state. Phases are
read off the tool: ``start_point`` set means the first click is down;
the arc knows its bulge step, the fillet its sizing step. Tools not in
the table fall back to their name."""
